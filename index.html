<h1>What is Reddit? A beginner&rsquo;s guide to the front page of the internet</h1>
<p>If you spend a lot of time online, you may have heard about Reddit. The site is billed as the "First page of the Internet ", and that is not an empty ostentatious: from this writing, Reddit is the fifth most popular site in the United States, according to Alexa, and the eighteenth worldwide. What exactly is Reddit? Essentially, it is a massive collection of forums, where people can share news and content or comment on other people's messages. That's all you need to know.</p>
<p>Reddit is divided into more than 1 million <a title="calico-kids communities" href="https://calico-kids.com">communities</a> known as "Reddits ", each covering a different theme. The name of a Reddit begins with/R/, which is part of the URLs used by Reddit. /r/nba, for example, is a Reddit where people talk about the National Basketball Association, while/R/Boardgames is a Reddit for people to discuss board games. They are simple reddits, but they can get strange, like/R/Birdswitharms, a Reddit dedicated to the images of the birds... with the arms. O/R/Ooer, a Reddit we found inexplicable (and a little painful to see).</p>
<p>If you're just looking for Reddit for the first time, you might be a little confused with what you're seeing, so here's a quick recap. The Home page (or "Front page ") shows several posts that are currently on the site, extracted from a variety of reddits. You can click the Sort button at the top left to sort the messages that are "Hot ", new, controversial, and more.</p>
<p>There is a search bar near the top, which can be used to find messages and reddits related to a term. The search for "World Cup ", for example, shows some popular messages about the World Cup, and relevant reddits like/R/Soccer.</p>
<p>Anyone with a Reddit account can create a Reddit for any topic (as long as it remains within the Community guidelines of the site). Reddits are managed by "Moderators ", volunteers who can edit the appearance of a particular reddit, dictate what types of content are allowed on the submarine, and even delete messages or content or prohibit Reddit users. Reddit as a whole is governed by administrators, Reddit employees who have vast powers throughout the site, including the ability to take moderators from their privileges and even prohibit all redditions of the site.

<p>Next to a post, you'll probably see the up and down arrows as well as a number. Users press the arrows to vote or downvote messages, increasing or decreasing their visibility, and the number reflects the current sum of votes and downvotes. Reddit users can also vote and downvote comments from other users, and each account has a number of "Karma " attached to it, indicating the amount of karma your comments received in total. Karma doesn't give you hip loot Reddit or anything like that, but it helps to increase your position in the Reddit community. Be proud of your karma! (or not; one might argue that it is an insipid number that simply shows how skillful it is to please the crowd.)</p>
<p>Like most online communities, Reddit has its own language. Redditers tend to speak in abbreviations such as OP, Til, IAmA and AMA. "OP " only refers to the "original poster " In a segment, while "til " means "Today I learned " and is one of the most common abbreviations you will see. Many posts are simple observations and realizations "til ". both "IAmA " and "AMA " refer to what may well be the most popular Reddit feature: the "Ask me nothing " thread. In a "AMA ", a well-known person like Barack Obama or Nick offerer, or someone who had an original life experience-or a heartbreaker, like the woman who was mutilated by a bear, struggled against her, and drove four miles down a mountain with s UA Guy hanging it s omete himsel F or herself for the curious minds of Reddit. The resulting lines are some of the most perceptive, humorous and fascinating interviews you have ever read.</p>
